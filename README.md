# fermenter

Requires an Arduino, DS18B20 temperature sensor, 1 channel relay, and pump and power supply (optionally reuse FTSs pump and power supply)

Controllable either through the Arduino IDE serial port, USB connected to a Raspberry PI that is running the brewery frontend, or your own serial implementation.
